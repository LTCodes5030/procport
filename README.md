# procport
A simple bash program that allows a user to find a process that is bound to a specific port, list details about it, and terminate the process.

Currently, this program is written entirely in Shell, with hopes of porting it to C++ and other languages for cross platform compatibility.

Tested versions:
- MacOS 12.x.x
- Ubuntu 22.04
